    "This threshold is constant, so it is independent from the length of the document/review. It is not based on the relative difference between negative and positive words, but on the absolute difference in negative and positive words. This leads to the problem that documents with a lot of words will always pass this constant threshold although their label is negative, assuming that positive words occur more than negative words relatively.\n",

    "In theory, it can increase quadratic with bigrams and cubed for trigrams, but this is only in the worst case where bigrams and trigrams occcur that are grammatically or semantically incorrect (e.g. 'The' followed by 'the' etc.). So in practice, this theory will be unlikely. Above you can see what we observed in practice: from unigrams to uni+bigrams we go from 45348 to 465262 features and from that we go to 1346107 features. This is not quadratic or cubed increase, but rather a (highly) linear increase."

    "We see that the accuracy when discarding closed class words increases with from 83.8% to 84.9%, which is a small increase. This means that the open class words contain the most important 'information' in the review and discarding the closed class words have no influence. This really makes sense, because the open-class words contain most sentimental meanings, whereas the closed class words (e.g. DET) do not. "

    "Throughout the assignment, we implemented three major sentiment detection approaches - The Lexicon-based approach, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines. After working out through the notebook, it can be clearly seen that relation between the word and the sentiment works much better than predefining lexicon based on the threshold which can be evidently seen in the results - 83.5% for Naive Bayes compared to 68% in Lexicon based approach. Incorporating the magnitude for strong and weak words in Lexicon based approach does not significantly improve the accuracy which suggests that magnitude information is not important. Also, it can be seen that the accuracy decreases by 2% on using smoothing in the Naive Bayes approach, this could be described by the inclusion of probabilities of the uncommon words which distorts the probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unexpectedly, the best features came out to be original words rather than the stemmed words or the bigrams and trigrams which can be evidently seen from the results(80.9% in Stemming NB, 68% in uni+bi, and 66% in uni+bi+tri). This can be explained by the fact that stemming discards some inherent useful information if there is no context available. An example of this is 'awful'(which is usually negative) and 'awfully' (which could be either, like \"awfully good\"). For n-grams, the accuracy decreases as previously mentioned, this is due to the fact that Naive Bayes assumes conditional independence while n-grams are not conditionally independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM performs better than Naive Bayes with smoothing but the difference is not significant(83.2% for SVM and 81.5% for NB with smoothing). SVM was also performed for POS disambiguation in which the POS tags of the words were also incorporated as there are a few words with different POS tags with respect to the sentiment. There is a very slight increase(0.6%) in the accuracy in this case as compared to the SVM in the previous case(83.8% SVM with POS tags), turns out that the POS tags do not encode additional information. In the final experiment, all the closed class words are discarded, which results in a slight increase in the accuracy (84.9%) which suggests that open class words have contained the more important information as compared to the closed class words, this is because the open-class words contain most sentimental meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we conclude that SVM performs the best followed by Naive Bayes, also original words were the best features as compared to the stemmed words or n-grams."
